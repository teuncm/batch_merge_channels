### Batch merge image channels

This piece of code is written for my girlfriend's lab work. Batch merge a folder of green/blue colored cells (stained using GFP/Hoechst/DAPI) like in ImageJ. Additionally, this repository contains an ImageJ macro to adjust the green channel (Hoechst) contrast/brightness of the merged images.

#### Naming convention
JPG files need to be named in pairs for the program to run successfully. Example:
```W1_G93A_D4_1_GFP.jpg
W1_G93A_D4_1_H.jpg
W1_G93A_D5_3_GFP.jpg
W1_G93A_D5_3_H.jpg```
